# Possible Scope: Genshark AI Visibility Dashboard vs Semrush API Capabilities

## 🚨 **Here's the Big Problem**

Look, I need to be straight with you. The Semrush API is designed for traditional SEO stuff - you know, keywords, backlinks, that kind of thing. But Genshark? It's a completely different beast. We're talking about an AI Visibility Dashboard that needs to track:

- **LLM Platform Mentions** (think ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, Gemini, Copilot)
- **AI Query Performance** - how well our content performs in AI searches
- **Generative Engine Optimization (GEO)** metrics - the new SEO for AI
- **AI Content Visibility** scoring - how visible our content is to AI systems
- **LLM Platform Share of Voice** - which AI platforms mention us most
- **AI Prompt Performance** tracking - how effective our prompts are
- **Generative Search Traffic** attribution - traffic coming from AI searches

## 📊 **The Bottom Line**

| Category | What We Need | Semrush API Has It | Kinda Has It | Doesn't Have It |
|-----------|--------------|-------------------|---------------|-----------------|
| **AI/GEO Core Metrics** | 12 things | 0 | 0 | 12 |
| **LLM Platform Analytics** | 8 things | 0 | 0 | 8 |
| **AI Content Performance** | 6 things | 0 | 0 | 6 |
| **Generative Search Traffic** | 5 things | 0 | 0 | 5 |
| **AI Prompt Analytics** | 4 things | 0 | 0 | 4 |
| **Traditional SEO (Nice to Have)** | 15 things | 12 | 2 | 1 |
| **TOTAL** | **50 things** | **12** | **2** | **36** |

## 🚀 **My Honest Recommendation**

### **Don't use the Semrush API as your main data source for Genshark.**

**Here's why:**
1. **No AI Platform Tracking**: The Semrush API doesn't track ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, Gemini, Copilot
2. **No LLM Mentions**: They don't monitor AI platform mentions
3. **No Generative Search**: They don't track AI-generated search queries
4. **No AI Content Scoring**: They don't provide AI content optimization
5. **No GEO Metrics**: They don't support Generative Engine Optimization

### **What You Should Do Instead:**

#### **For AI/GEO Data:**
- **Custom AI Monitoring**: Build your own scrapers for LLM platforms
- **AI Platform APIs**: Go directly to ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity APIs
- **Social Media APIs**: Track AI mentions on Twitter, LinkedIn, Reddit
- **News APIs**: Monitor AI mentions in news articles
- **Custom Analytics**: Build AI-specific analytics from scratch

#### **For Traditional SEO (Bonus):**
- **Semrush API**: Use it for traditional SEO data as a bonus feature
- **Google Search Console**: For search performance data
- **Google Analytics**: For traffic and user behavior data

#### **For Platform Features:**
- **User Management**: Auth0, Firebase Auth, or build your own
- **Billing**: Stripe, PayPal, or similar payment processors
- **A/B Testing**: Google Optimize, Optimizely, or build your own
- **System Monitoring**: New Relic, DataDog, or similar APM tools

---

## 📈 **The Real Numbers**

- **Data Coverage**: 24% of what we need is supported by the Semrush API (only traditional SEO)
- **AI/GEO Coverage**: 0% - The Semrush API provides no AI/GEO data
- **Integration Complexity**: Very High (requires building AI monitoring from scratch)
- **Time to Market**: 12+ months for core AI features, 18+ months for full platform
- **Cost Efficiency**: Low (Semrush API only provides bonus traditional SEO data)

---

## 🎯 **Bottom Line**

**Don't use the Semrush API as the primary data source for Genshark.**

**Instead:**
1. **Build custom AI monitoring** for LLM platforms and mentions
2. **Integrate directly with AI platform APIs** where available
3. **Use the Semrush API only as a bonus feature** for traditional SEO data
4. **Focus on AI/GEO-specific data sources** and custom development

**Genshark needs to be built as a specialized AI visibility platform, not a traditional SEO tool.**

*This analysis shows that the Semrush API is fundamentally incompatible with Genshark's core AI/GEO requirements and would require a complete pivot away from the AI visibility focus.*
